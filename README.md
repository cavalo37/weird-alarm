# weird-alarm
Brain fart not sure if it works or not i was too lazy to test it out


What it was SUPPOSED to do is:

Prompt user for active time

If app is active during said time, upon screen turning off it creates an alarm for 8 hours after that or 8.5 hours after that if insomnia mode is activated.

If screen is turned on during that time, it deleted previous alarms and creates a new one when it finally closes again to ensure 8 hours of rest :]
